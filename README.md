# Uber-Trip-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Project

The rise of ride-hailing platforms like Uber has led to a significant increase in the volume of trip data collected. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to analyze ride patterns, understand customer behavior, and predict future demand. This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data collected in New York City during 2014 and early 2015. The aim is to uncover trends, build predictive models, and evaluate model performance using machine learning techniques.
